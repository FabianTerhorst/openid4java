... OpenID Infocards / OpenID Infocard Demo RP : INSTALL

========================================================================

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS


Introduction:

This document describes how to install, configure and use the OpenID
Infocard Relying Party.

The Relying Party requires an OpenID Identifier for login, but unlike
regular OpenID Relying Parties, login is requested using Information
Cards mechanisms (see the "application/x-informationCard" <OBJECT> element
in project/www/WEB-INF/jsp/login.jsp).

After the Identity Selector posts the response, the Relying Party extracts
the OpenID Authentication Response from the xmlToken POST parameter and
continues with the regular OpenID (direct) verification.


Configuration:

    project/www/WEB-INF/classes/config.properties :

    - base.url : The base URL (without the context path)
                 where the RP will be deployed


Build and Installation:

  In the project/ folder, run

    ant

  This will create a deployable dist/demo.war file.
