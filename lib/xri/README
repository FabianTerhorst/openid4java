OpenXRI dependencies and endorsed libraries:

    The JAR files under this folder need to be copied under the
    application's classpath.

    The JAR files under the endorsed/ folder need to be copied under
    your environment's endorsed libraries folder. If you are running a
    webapplication under Apache Tomcat, this directory can be found at:

        JAVA_HOME/lib/endorsed
     or
        CATALINA_HOME/common/endorsed

    For other application servers or environments, please consult their
    documentation for configuring endorsed libraries.
